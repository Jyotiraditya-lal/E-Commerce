                Expense tracking is important in creating a budget for your small business. 
                Keeping a daily record of your expenses by tracking receipts, invoices, and other outgoing expenses improves the financial health of your budget. 
                Tracking expenses can help you stay on top of your cash flow and prepare you for tax season.

                <br />
                Expense tracking means recording all your expenditures so you have a clear and detailed understanding of your budget. 
                This is typically done for a certain project or over a certain period, so you can stay on budget and make any necessary adjustments. 
                <br />
                For many small businesses, expense tracking may include fixed expenses like rent and utilities as well as fluctuating costs like labor, product orders, and advertising.
                Its especially important to record one-time and variable costs, as these arent always accounted for in the initial budget.
